# cli-snake  

CLI Snake in Python (i am not obfuscating it anymore because im too lazy)  
this is written very similiarly to my [cli-flappy-bird](https://github.com/carpetmaker3162/cli-flappy-bird) (so basically just as unreadable)  

**Issues:**  
- You can run into yourself and die if you make a U-turn too fast
- IndexError when going out of bounds rightwards or downwards (was too lazy to fix this)
